			<h2>What is a Web Developer? How Do I Become One?</h2>
		   	<p>This website won't teach you to be a web developer. There are literally thousands of free websites, tutorials, guides, and resources out there for that (if anything, there are too many). Instead the goal of here is to teach you <em>how to learn</em>. If you're just getting started, you don't know <strong>where</strong> to start. You don't know what you don't know. So you don't know what you need to study, and it's hard to ask good questions.</p>

		   	<p>In 2013, I was in the same position. I knew I wanted to learn web development, but I didn't have a clue where to begin. Eventually, I went to a web development bootcamp. That helped a lot, but half of what I learned there was what I needed to learn. Had I known that before, I'd have learned even more! Also, it was expensive, and this is all FREE!.</p>

				<h2>So What is This Page Going to Do For Me?</h2>
				<p>This website is intended to provide a roadmap of sorts. A road map to becoming a front end web developer. I am a front end dev, and they say "write what you know", so that's what I am focusing on here. If you want to be a back end dev, or a database admin, or a Wordpress dev, or anything else, I can't help you. Try Googling it. </p>
				<p>If you follow my roadmap, you WILL build the skills you need to be a web dev. It won't be easy and it won't be quick, but it won't be incredibly hard or take a really long time either. Figure on about a year, if you work at it diligently. Say 30 minutes to an hour a day, and maybe a couple hours on the weekends. It's definitely something you can do while in school or working full time.

			<h2>Who Even Gives a Crap About Web Development?</h2>
			<p>You should, doofus. This is a jobskill you can learn on your own, for free, with no college involved, that pays well. You know how rare that is these days? And once you get halfway decent at it, you can be making more than your dad makes after 25 years as a line manager down at the widget plant.</p>

			<p>Even if you decide you don't want to build and maintain web sites for a living, it's still a great skill to have. It teaches you to think analytically, and looks good on your resume. Especially to a baby-boomer aged hiring manager who thinks anyone who can reinstall a printer driver is a sorcerer.</p>

			<p>So, are you ready to get started, or what? </p>
