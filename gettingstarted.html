			<h2>Getting Started as a Front End Web Developer</h2>
		   	<p>What is a front end web developer? They are a breed of computer programmer that builds the part of the web site that the user sees and interacts with. They may or may not design the web site. Technically, a <em>web designer</em> is a different job, focusing more on the art, and less on the tech. So a front end dev might be building a site from a design done by someone else, or they may have a hand in the design themself. Or they may be building a new page that's part of a larger pre-existing site and needs to match the style of the other pages.</p>

		   	<p>An eye for detail and a bit of artistic inclination is important. Check out some of <a href="http://www.verynicesites.com/" target="_blank">these websites</a>. They're beautiful, and elegant, and very well done. Now check out <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/6138384/The-oldest-surviving-web-pages.html" target="_blank">these websites from the 1990s</a>. Very primitive. Can you think of a single other art form that has come so far so fast?</p>
		   	<p>To be part of this field, there are some things you are going to need. Relax, they aren't expensive. In fact, the vast majority of them are free. A plumber or mechanic usually ends up spending far more on his tools than does a developer.</p>

			<h3>A Computer</h3>
			<p>You're going to need a computer. I know I said you could learn to code for free, but you gotta have a computer. Sorry, I lied. Either a PC or a Mac will work, although I am partial to Macs (as is the industry). But you can use either. I would also highly recommend a laptop over a desktop. As some point down the line you are going to want to start attending events, meetups and hackathons and whatnot. A laptop is obviously way better for this.</p>
			<p> If you are dead-broke and all you've got is an old Pentium-II with a floppy drive, it'll do. But you can go on Craigslist and get a 5 year old PC laptop for around $100. Then pay that geeky kid down the street who loves Doctor Who a few bucks to put Windows 7 on it and upgrade the RAM and you'll be good to go.</p>

			<h3>Text Editing Program</h3>
			<p>Computer programs are written in a text editor. It's very similar to a word processor, but they aren't the same. Don't use a word processor, like Microsoft Word or Wordpad, to write code. They add various types of formatting behind the scenes that will mess with your code. Notepad, which comes as part of Windows, will work. But I highly recommend you download Sublime Text. It's a free program, it's very popular in the industry, and it automatically colors different parts of your code based on the type of file.</p>
			<p>Sublime Text is funded by donations. So use it free for now and someday, when you're a professional web dev making the big bucks, Paypal them $50. That seems fair.</p>

			<h3>Code Repository</h3>
			<p>In the beginning, you can create a folder on your computer and keep all your code files there. But eventually, you're going to want to store them online for other coders (and potential employers) to check out. There will also come a time when you are part of a group of people working on a single project, and you can't just keep emailing it back and forth to each other.</p>
			<p>That's what GitHub is for. It's a free website that allows you to host your code online. Each program will have it's own repository, and you can continually update these repositories from your computer. It can be a little complicated, so don't worry about it yet. Just keep all your code in a folder for now, and when you get to the section on GitHub, it will be explained in much greater detail.</p>

			<h3>Internet Browser</h3>
			<p>You've already got one, everybody does. Internet Explorer comes with Windows, Safari comes on Macs. I use Google Chrome, and highly recommend you do too. Chrome has a set of features called Developer Tools that allows you to view the code behind web sites, debug, and track network performance. This is just one more reason I prefer Chrome over the other browsers. <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools">More info here on Chrome Developer Tools.</a></p>

			<h3>Skills</h3>
			<p>These are things that you are going to need that you can't just download. Every job has its required skills. Surgeons have to be able to stand the sight of blood. Gymnasts need good balance. Cops have to love donuts. Coders are no different. There a few things you are going to have to practice at if you ever want to be any good at this job.</p>
			<br><br>
			<p><em><strong>Finding Answers</strong></em>: The #1 skill a dev must learn. No-one can remember it all; there's too much info out there, and it changes regulary. You need to be at least a blue belt in <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Google-fu" target="_blank">Google-Fu</a>. Solving complex problems through research is 60% of coding.
			<p>The creators of web technologies almost always write documentation to explain its use. Finding that documentation, and then finding the info in it that you need is Absolutely Essential. In each section of this web site, I have provided some examples of documentation, under "Resources" in the "Ready to Learn" section at the bottom of the page.</p>
			<br><br>
			<p><em><strong>Tenacity</strong></em>: If you give up easy, you can't do this job. You just can't. When you first start learning, you're going to feel stupid for a good long while. It's a steep learning curve. But if you stick with it, a some point you are going to suddenly realize that you know a lot more about software, the internet, and computers in general than you did just a short time before. Knowledge and understanding will sneak up and surprise you. When you start dreaming in code, that's a good sign.</p>
			<br><br>
			<p><em><strong>Regular Practice</strong></em>: Remember that part in <em>The Karate Kid</em> when Mr. Miyagi sees Daniel-san trying to learn karate from a book and kind of chuckles to himself? The only way to learn to code is to code. You have to practice regularly. Reading isn't going to cut it, watching tutorial videos won't cut it. You've got to practice regularly. Keep creating web pages, even if it's silly. <em>Especially</em> if it's silly. Having fun with it is the best way to learn anything. If do right, no can defense!</p>
